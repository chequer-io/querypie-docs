    2. Time-limited items only : Only displays servers with time-based permissions in the list.
    3. Search by Host : Changes the search criteria for the server list from the existing server name to Host (IP address). At the same time, the display method of the server list also switches to Host. When the toggle is disabled, you can only search by server name.

**Q. I'm getting an error that the connection failed. Why is this happening?**
A. Connection may fail if the permission status has changed or if you attempt to connect during a time or day when access is not allowed.
Also, connection may not be possible due to the administrator's server information settings, so please contact the administrator for detailed information.
