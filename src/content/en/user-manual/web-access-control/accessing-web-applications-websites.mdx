# Accessing Web Applications (Websites)

### Overview

Users can view the list of web applications (websites) they have been granted access to and safely work by connecting to each web application or SaaS platform. To access, you must first have a Role with access permissions. Select an appropriate Role or, if you don't have a Role, request permission to access web applications through Workflow.

* On the Role selection screen displayed when first accessing the Web Applications menu, select the Role you want to use for access.
    * Web access permissions vary by Role, and if you don't have an assigned Role, you will be redirected to Workflow.
    * When selecting a Just In Time Role, you will see Web Apps where you are designated as Owner or Member, and you must receive approval through the `Web App Just-In-Time Access Request` in Workflow before accessing the target Web App. You can only access for the approved duration.
