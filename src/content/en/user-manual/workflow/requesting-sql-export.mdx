# Requesting SQL Export Request

### Overview

You can submit SQL Export Request by following the steps below.
This requests data export for which you do not have permission on specific DB connections, and after approval, the executor can execute the approved data export once.


### Requesting SQL Export Request

#### 1. Selecting Approval Rules

* Select an Approval Rule to choose the appropriate approval rule for your purpose. The approval target varies depending on the selected rule.
* If a pre-configured approval rule is selected, the approver is automatically assigned and cannot be added or modified.
* **Approval Expiration Date**: Enter the approval expiration date. The maximum value can be set through Maximum Approval Duration. The Approval Expiration Date cannot exceed the Execution Expiration Date. If exceeded, the request cannot be submitted.
    * However, when submitting in Urgent Mode, the above condition is ignored.
