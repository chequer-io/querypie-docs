### IP Registration Request When Login is Blocked

When the IP access control policy (`Require Allowed Zones for User Access`) is activated by the administrator, attempting to log in from an IP not in the allow list will block the login and redirect to a dedicated page for IP registration.

On this page, you can request IP registration by following the procedures below.

1.  **Select Approval Rule** : Select the approval rule to use from the dropdown list.
2.  **Enter IP Addresses** : Enter the IP addresses for which you want to allow access, separated by commas (`,`). (Maximum 20)
3.  **Submit Request** : Submit the request by clicking the `Submit` button.


#### Auto-filled Items

When submitting a request from the login block page, the following items are automatically generated and filled by the system for user convenience.

*  **Title** : `IP Registration Request from {User Name} ({Login ID})`
*  **Reason for Request** : `I, {User Name}, am requesting IP registration because I am currently unable to access the system with my existing IP address. Please allow access from the IP address provided.`
*  **Due Date** : Automatically set to one year from the request date.


#### After Request Submission

Once you submit a request, you cannot submit a new IP registration request until that request is processed (approved or rejected).
If the request is successfully submitted, a screen indicating that the request has been properly received will be displayed along with the message 'Your IP request has been received.'

<Callout type="info">
**Q. Even after receiving IP registration approval, I'm redirected to the IP registration request page instead of the login page. How can I resolve this?**
A. To resolve this, we have provided a  **login page**  link on the IP blocking and registration request page.
Clicking this link will allow you to access the login page normally.
