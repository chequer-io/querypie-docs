# Requesting Server Privilege Request

### Overview

Using Server Privilege Request, you can easily request temporary command usage permissions for servers.
You can select and apply for the temporary command usage time and the start time of permissions (immediately upon approval or from server access time).
This feature only supports SSH protocol communication.

### Server Privilege Request

#### 1. Selecting Approval Rules

* Select an Approval Rule to choose the appropriate approval rule for your purpose. The approval target varies depending on the selected rule.
* If a pre-configured approval rule is selected, the approver is automatically assigned and cannot be added or modified.
*  **Approval Expiration Date** : Enter the approval expiration date. The maximum value can be set through Maximum Approval Duration. The Approval Expiration Date cannot exceed the Privilege Expiration Date. If exceeded, the request cannot be submitted. If Maximum Approval Duration &gt; Maximum Access Duration, the value of Maximum Approval Duration is applied the same as the value of Maximum Access Duration. Example) If Maximum Approval Duration is 14 days and Maximum Access Duration is 5 days, the value of Maximum Approval Duration is also applied as 5 days.
    * However, when submitting in Urgent Mode, the above condition is ignored.
