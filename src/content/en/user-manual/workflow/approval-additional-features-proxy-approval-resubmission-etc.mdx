    2. For requests with Review Status of **Unread**, only those allow `Confirm` to be possible.
2. Click the `Confirm` button in the top right of the request detail page to display a popup window where you can enter comments.
3. Enter your review opinion and click the `OK` button to complete the confirmation.
4. When you return to the All Reviews list, you can see that the Review Status value has changed to **Confirmed**.



### Using Proxy Approval

Proxy approval is a feature that delegates the approver role to another user for a certain period.
The usage method is as follows:

#### 1. Setting Up Proxy Approval

* **End Date**: Proxy approval end date
* **Delegation Reason**: Enter the reason for setting up proxy approval
* **Save**: When you enter the `Save` button, the proxy approval settings are saved. If the start date is today, it is applied immediately upon `Save`.

#### 2. Checking Proxy Approval Setting Status

During the proxy approval setting period, the following is displayed in the top menu bar when the original approver and proxy approver access:

<Callout type="info">

The requester can select Approval Rule and Approver as usual.
</Callout>

#### 3. Processing Delegated Proxy Approval Requests

* During the proxy approval setting period, the requests that the proxy approver can check are as follows:
    * **Received Requests &gt; To Do**: List of unprocessed requests received by the original approver (including requests received before the setting period)
    * **Received Requests &gt; Done**: You can view requests processed by the proxy approver within the proxy approval setting period.
* You can approve or reject on the detail page, and when entering comments, a message indicating that you are in proxy approval is displayed.

#### 4. Checking Requests Processed by Proxy Approval

* You can check whether the request was processed by the original approver or proxy approver in the approval status within the request detail page as follows:
**When processed by the original approver**

<Callout type="info">
If you are using request notifications through Slack DM, Workflow step-by-step notifications are also sent to the proxy approver.
For detailed information about Slack DM notifications, please refer to the [Using Slack DM Personal Notifications](../../administrator-manual/general/system/integrations/integrating-with-slack-dm/slack-dm-workflow-notification-types) document.
</Callout>

#### 5. How to View Drafts After Proxy Approval Setting Ends

* Even after the proxy approval setting period ends, you can check requests processed by the proxy approver within the proxy approval setting period in the Received Requests &gt; Done list. Other requests can no longer be viewed or processed.


### Resubmitting Existing Requests

You can resubmit approval requests with the same content repeatedly or for rejected approval items as follows:
