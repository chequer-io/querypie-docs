# Kubernetes Logs

### Overview

All activities in QueryPie are recorded in audit logs.
User and administrator login/logout, permission grants and revocations, API execution history for Kubernetes, resource or security configuration changes, and all activity history occurring in QueryPie and access-controlled target resources are subject to logging.
Real-time recorded logs can be searched and filtered with various conditions.
