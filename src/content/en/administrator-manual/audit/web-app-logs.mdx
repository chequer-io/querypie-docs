# Web App Logs

### Overview

All web app activities in QueryPie are recorded in audit logs.
User and administrator login/logout, permission grants and revocations, execution history for web applications, resource or security configuration changes, and all activity history occurring in QueryPie and access-controlled target resources are subject to logging.
Real-time recorded logs can be searched and filtered with various conditions.
