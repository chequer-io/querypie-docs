# Communicating with Clusters through Reverse Tunnel

### Communicating with Clusters through Reverse Tunnel

QueryPie supports Reverse Tunneling as a means to communicate with resources in different Network Zones.
When you install a Reverse Tunnel Agent in the Network Zone you want to communicate with, the Reverse Tunnel Agent establishes a connection toward QueryPie (Outbound).

You can communicate from QueryPie to resources in different Network Zones through Reverse Tunnels by adding Tags to resources (clusters).

### Applying Reverse Tunnel to Clusters

1. Navigate to Administrator &gt; Kubernetes &gt; Connection Management &gt; Clusters menu.
2. Select a cluster from the list. For new cluster registration, refer to [Manually Registering Kubernetes Clusters](../../../kubernetes/connection-management/clusters/manually-registering-kubernetes-clusters).
3. Add the following Tag to the Tags section in the Clusters List Detail page.
    1. `RTS = TRUE` : Clusters with this Tag will attempt to communicate through Reverse Tunnels.
    2. Reverse Tunnel Agent Tag : Communicates with the cluster through a Reverse Tunnel Agent with the same Tag. If there is no Reverse Tunnel Agent with the same Tag, communication will fail.
4. Click the `Save Changes` button to save the settings.
