        * Example: `DB Connection Created`, `Server Updated`, `Kubernetes Policy Deleted`
    2. `{Resource type that was changed}` `{Resource type that was modified}` `{Created | Updated | Deleted | Assigned | Unassigned…}` : When another resource was added, modified, deleted, assigned, or revoked to a specific resource
        * Example: `Server Group Server Added`, `Server Group Account Updated` , `Kubernetes Role Policy Unassigned`
    3. You can filter the log list by specific Action Type.
4.  **Target**  : In Activity Logs, you can check the name of the resource type that was changed due to administrator actions.

1. Click on a row in the list to open a Drawer and view detailed content.
2.  **Affected Data**  : Displays the data details that were changed by the action. The meaning of each column is as follows:
    1. Label : Data column name
    2. Before : Value before the action
    3. After : Value after the action
3.  **Related Logs**  : Displays logs that occurred in a chain or simultaneously for the action. Includes both before and after logs.
    1. You can check not only actions directly caused by administrators, but also automatic system actions derived from them.
    2. Action logs displayed in Related Logs are also kept as individual logs.

<Callout type="info">
From 11.3.0, a "Changes Only" checkbox has been added to the Activity Logs detail view (Drawer) so you can filter to see only changed items.
Also, empty values are displayed as "&lt;null&gt;" instead of “-(dash)”.
