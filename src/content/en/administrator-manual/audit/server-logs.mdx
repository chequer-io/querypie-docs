# Server Logs

### Overview

You can view logs generated from QueryPie's System Access Control in Server Logs.
You can check information such as server access permission grants and revocations, server login/logout, and executed command history.
Additionally, you can view the list of sessions connected through QueryPie or force terminate sessions.
