1. <Badge color="blue">Step 1</Badge> Finally confirm all accounts selected to ensure there are no incorrectly granted accounts. If you want to make changes, you can click the `Previous` button to go back to the previous step. 
2. Each policy item is as follows:
    1.  **`{n}` Server(s) selected**  : This item displays the number of Servers selected in <Badge color="blue">Step 1</Badge> x the number of Accounts. Clicking shows each item in list format.
    2.  **Set Permissions by Minute**  : When this option is selected, server access permissions can be set in minutes. When the checkbox is selected, the following setting items are activated.
        1. Start Trigger : Select the permission grant start condition
            1. Access to the Server : Permissions are activated immediately when the user accesses the server. Regardless of server session maintenance, server access is possible for the specified period from the activation time. 
            2. Grant : The timer starts immediately upon permission grant, and permissions are valid only for the specified period regardless of the user's actual access.
        2.  **Duration(Minutes)** : Enter the valid time in minutes for the permission.
    3.  **Expiration Date**  : Set the access permission expiration date. Can be set up to a maximum of 1 year. (Default = 1 year later) 
    4.  **Protocols**  : Use the protocol to be used for server access. 
    5.  **Command Template**  : Set the command set that cannot be used after accessing the server. You can check the detailed conditions set by clicking Command Template Details below.<br/>*Limitation: (10.2.1) Only Command Templates set to Deny can be used in Grant Permissions.
    6.  **Configure Whitelist**  : Supports exception handling for specific commands in the process of controlling commands through Command Template. When the Configure Whitelist checkbox is checked, the following settings appear: 
        1.  **Commands**  : Enter commands that need to be allowed.
            1.  **Keyword**  : Enter as keyword (ls, cat, etc.)
            2.  **RegEx**  : Enter as regular expression (^sudo\b[^&|;\n]*$, etc.)
        2.  **Whitelist Expiration Date**  : Specify a separate exception handling expiration date for the above commands.
    7.  **Require Privilege** : When this option is activated, users must go through an approval process through Server Privilege Request workflow to access servers with that account. This is useful when temporarily allowing and managing access to high-privilege accounts such as administrator (Admin) accounts on Windows servers.
        * When attempting to access with an account where this option is activated, the `Connect` button is disabled when accessing the server from the user dashboard, and a message is displayed indicating that an access permission request must be submitted.
        * The Require Privilege option can be applied to all accounts regardless of the server's OS type.
    8.  **Access Start Time**  : Set the allowed access start time.
    9.  **Access End Time**  : Set the allowed access end time.
    10.  **Access Weekday**  : Set the days of the week when access is allowed.
    11.  **IP Addresses**  : Set the IP addresses allowed for access.
    12.  **Command Audit**  : Set whether to log commands used in sessions connected through this Permission.
    13.  **Command Detection**  : Set whether to detect prohibited commands within Script/Alias when they are called.<br/>*Limitation: (10.2.1) Only works in Bash Shell, commands that call other Scripts from Script are blocked
    14.  **Proxy Usage**  : Set whether to allow server access through QueryPie Agent with this Permission. 
    15.  **Max Sessions**  : Limit the number of concurrent sessions a user can have on a single server.
