# ProxyJump Configurations

### Overview

Supports access control for servers in different Network Zones from QueryPie or when CIDR overlaps.
Through ProxyJump settings, you can connect to target servers through Jump Hosts installed in other Network Zones or VPCs.
When users attempt to connect to servers displayed in QueryPie, they can connect in the same way as servers that do not go through Jump Hosts.
This allows you to control unnecessary user access to Jump Hosts.
