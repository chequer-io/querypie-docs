# Privilege Type

### Overview

The Privilege feature allows privilege control through SQL statement combinations.
In addition, for web editors, you can control data export/import and clipboard copy functions.
SQL statements are classified according to ANSI SQL standards, and Redis provides separate Privilege Types.


### Creating Privileges

<Callout type="important">
When creating privileges, MySQL-based SET, SHOW, DESCRIBE, and USE statements are included in all privileges by default.

3. Enter the following information for policy creation:
    1.  **Name**: Name that can distinguish the privilege on screen.
    2.  **Database Type**: Select the type of database to which the privilege is granted. By default, select the General type.
    3.  **Privilege Type**: Select the statements to allow execution with this privilege.
    4.  **Functions**: Select the operations allowed with this privilege. You can control data export/import and clipboard copy functions within web editors.

You can verify that the privilege has been created in the Privilege Type list.

**How can I create and manage access privileges for Redis connections?**

When selecting Database Type as Redis in the Privilege creation screen, you can create Privileges with separate Redis-specific privilege types.

* Privileges allowed for execution when accessing Redis are largely classified into Read, Write, Dangerous, and Etc.
* Read, Write, Dangerous, and Etc. categories refer to [Redis ACL Categories](https://redis.io/commands/) standards.
* Among selected categories, you can restrict execution by setting commands to restrict in Restrict Commands.
