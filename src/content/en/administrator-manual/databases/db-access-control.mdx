# DB Access Control

### Overview

The DB Access Control menu provides various forms of access control based on roles and attributes to manage database access and security at a high level. Only authenticated users can access databases that have been granted access permissions through QueryPie, and SQL execution is restricted based on predefined SQL statement combinations. From initial QueryPie user authentication to database access, important data can be safely protected through IP range control, long-term non-access control, time and day-of-week control, table/column query restrictions, etc., and all changes to security policies are immediately applied to user sessions so that updated measures can be applied in real time.
