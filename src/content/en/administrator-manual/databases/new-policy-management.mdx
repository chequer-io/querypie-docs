# (New) Policy Management

### Overview

The existing QueryPie DAC provides data policies such as Data Access, Data Masking, Sensitive Data.
Ledger Table Management.
However, these policies must be set individually for each connection, and rules must be applied for each table and column.
And it does not provide import and export functions for policies.

From 10.2.6, to improve these inconveniences, a new policy management feature is provided.
Through the tag-based policy application feature, after mapping DBMS paths and tags, when policies are applied, policies can be dynamically assigned by tags.
You can set access to only specific tables through tags assigned to tables.

### Using the New Policy Management Feature

To use the new policy management feature, you must first enable the feature.

In General &gt; Company management &gt; Security, set New DAC Policy Management to `Enable` in the DB Connection Security sub-item.
(Default value Disable)<br/>
