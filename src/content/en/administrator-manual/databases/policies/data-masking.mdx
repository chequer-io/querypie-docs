# Data Masking

### Overview

You can set policies to mask and display data that requires management within your organization, such as personal information or sensitive data, when viewing.
In the Data Masking menu, you can select the connection for which to set policies, create policies, and register and manage rules for data that needs masking on a column basis.


### Creating Data Masking Policies

Register new masking policies by connection.

After creating a policy, register the path of the data to which the policy will be applied as a rule.

1. Click on the policy you created in the Data Masking menu.
2. The policy details and rule registration screen will be displayed. `Add Rule List` Click the button on the right.
3. Select the path of the data to apply the policy to in order:
    1.  **Database Name**  : Required value for rule registration.
    2.  **Table Name**  : Required value for rule registration.
    3.  **Column Name**  : Required value for rule registration.
4. Apply masking patterns:
    1. Select one or more masking patterns to apply to the column selected in step 3.
    2. By default, patterns for masking about 20 types of personal information and sensitive data are provided.
    3. You can create detection patterns and masking patterns directly through regular expressions in the Masking Pattern menu.
5. You can make exceptions to masking rules for users or groups who need to view the data:
    *  **Allowed Users**  : Select users or groups to make exceptions for this rule.
6. `Ok` Save through the button.

You can confirm that the rule has been registered in the Rule List tab.
Now when users view the data, it will be displayed masked according to the applied masking pattern, such as '*****@gmail.com'.
