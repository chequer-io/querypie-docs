# Data Access

### Overview

You can set policies so that data requiring access restrictions such as personal information or sensitive information within an organization cannot be viewed during queries.
In the Data Access menu, you can select connections to set policies, create policies, and register and manage rules for data requiring access restrictions by table or column criteria.

### Creating Table/Column Access Restriction Policies

Register new table/column access restriction policies by connection.

1. Navigate to Policies &gt; Data Access menu from the Database settings menu.
2. `Create Policy` Click the button in the top right.
3. Enter the following information for policy creation:
    1.  **Policy Name**  : Name that can distinguish the policy on screen.
    2.  **Target Connection**  : Select the connection to apply the policy to. One policy can be connected to one connection.
4. `Save` Save through the button.

You can check that the policy has been created in the Data Access policy list.

After creating a policy, register the data path to which the policy will be applied as rules.

1. Click the policy created in the Data Access menu.
2. `Add Rule List` The policy detail information and rule registration screen is displayed, click the button on the right.
3. Select the data path to which the policy will be applied in order. 
    1.  **Database Name**  : Required value for rule registration.
    2.  **Table Name**  : Required value for rule registration. When only table is selected, querying the table itself is restricted.
    3.  **Column Name**  : Select when you want to restrict data access by column unit.
4. Exception handling of table/column access restriction rules can be done for users or groups who need to query the data. 
    *  **Allowed Users**  : Select users or groups to exception handle the rule.
5. `Ok` Save by clicking the button.

You can check that rules are registered in the Rule List tab.
Now when users query the data, if policy is applied to the table, the table itself cannot be queried, and if rules are applied to columns, it is displayed as *`{RESTRICTED}`*.
