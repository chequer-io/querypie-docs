<Callout type="important">
Only users manually registered in QueryPie can have their passwords reset.
Authentication methods for users integrated through SCIM are managed in SCIM.
</Callout>

Password reset is performed through temporary password issuance.
Administrators must issue temporary passwords in the user detail page and guide users to the temporary passwords.

#### Issuing Temporary Passwords

<figure data-layout="center" data-align="center">
<img src="/administrator-manual/general/user-management/users/image-20241218-194814.png" alt="Administrator &gt; General &gt; User Management &gt; Users &gt; List Details &gt; Authentication" width="760" />

</figure>

2. After entering the temporary password, click the `Confirm` button to complete temporary password issuance.

<Callout type="info">
From QueryPie 10.2.2, when Email integration is configured, administrators can send reset emails to allow users to reset their own passwords instead of specifying temporary passwords.

1. The administrator clicks the `Reset Password` button in the user detail page.
2. In the "Password change method" of the popup window, select "User changes own password (via email)" and click the `Confirm` button to send a password reset email to the user's email address.

<figure data-layout="center" data-align="center">

</figcaption>
</figure>

The content of the email that users will receive is similar to the following.
The password reset link is valid for 30 minutes.
If the user does not access this link for more than 30 minutes, they cannot reset their password through this link, so the administrator must perform the above procedure (User changes own password (via email)) again to send a password reset email.
