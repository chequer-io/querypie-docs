# Licenses

### Overview

The Licenses page allows you to upload/delete and check the status of product license keys currently active in QueryPie.

<Callout type="info">
From 11.3.0, administrators can upload license keys in Admin &gt; General &gt; Company Management &gt; Licenses.
Also, the license statuses have changed from Active / Expired / Waiting to Activated / Available / Scheduled / Expired.
From 11.3.0, license validation has been strengthened, and if there is an invalid license, the QueryPie app would not run (invalid licenses had to be deleted).
From 11.5.0, even if license validation errors occur, QueryPie can be used normally with other valid licenses.
Invalid licenses are displayed in the Expired License list and cannot be selected.
