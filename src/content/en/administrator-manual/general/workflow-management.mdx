# Workflow Management

### Overview

Workflow is a feature that supports requesting approval for various tasks requiring authorization within QueryPie, from approval to actual task execution. Workflow Management is an administrator-side feature for managing workflows, where you can manage the entire request list and approval rules. You can also configure approval settings for the entire workflow.

* [All Requests](workflow-management/all-requests) : View all requests submitted through workflows and check detailed information.
* [Approval Rules](workflow-management/approval-rules) : Manage approval rules.
* [Workflow Configurations](workflow-management/workflow-configurations) : Configure approval submission and approval processes.

#### Slack DM Notification Settings

You can receive step-by-step content of requests through Slack DM and process them directly. For Slack integration methods to send Slack DM notifications, refer to the [Slack DM Integration](system/integrations/integrating-with-slack-dm) document.
