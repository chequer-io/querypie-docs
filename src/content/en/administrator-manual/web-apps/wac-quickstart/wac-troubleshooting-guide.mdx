# WAC Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides guidance on problems that may occur during WAC use and their solutions.

#### When access policies are not applied or audit logs are missing in tests immediately after Extension (QueryPie Web Secure) installation

Management is not guaranteed for tabs that were open before WAC extension installation.

To prevent such situations, please close all existing browser tabs and windows before installing the extension.


#### When WebApp access fails and the browser displays an `ERR_TIMED_OUT` error message

This may be a phenomenon that occurs when the browser cannot connect to the WAC Proxy.

First, check if the WAC Proxy address is properly set in the Admin &gt; Web Apps &gt; Web app Configuration menu.

Run the following command in the local terminal of the browser where the problem occurred to check if the connection to WAC Proxy is working.

First, check if port access is possible using nc(netcat) CLI.
```
$ nc -vz internal-proxy.querypie.io 7447
Connection to internal-proxy.querypie.io port 7447 [tcp/*] succeeded!
```

If nc connection works well, check if HTTP requests and responses are working properly with curl command as shown below.

If nc connection works well, check if HTTP requests and responses are working properly with curl command as shown below.
```
$ $ curl -v -k https://internal-proxy.querypie.io:7447

```

If the same issue persists even after proceeding this far, Chrome browser network logs are needed.

**Execution Method**

* Open `chrome://net-export/` in Chrome browser and click Start Over. (Select the default option `Strip private information`.)

</figure>

* Enter the WebApp address that cannot be accessed in Chrome browser and navigate to it.
* Confirm that the issue has been reproduced, then go back to the `chrome://net-export/` tab and click Stop Logging.
* Copy the Chrome browser network log file.

**Log Analysis Method**

* Access [https://netlog-viewer.appspot.com/](https://netlog-viewer.appspot.com/).
* Upload the log file received above in the Import menu on the left.
* Check network transmission and reception content in the Events menu on the left.

#### When Chrome browser's managed login window appears after PC wakes up from long sleep mode

When a PC enters sleep mode and then wakes up, a login window managed by Chrome browser may appear.

This login window appears because browser Proxy authentication failed, and authentication will not work even if you enter QueryPie ID and password.

In this case, you can use the product normally again by proceeding as follows.

**Solution:**

1. Log in to the extension again.
2. Select a Role.
3. Refresh the tab that displays the login window managed by Chrome browser.


#### When mouse clicks become unresponsive in web browser due to QueryPie API server failure

When QueryPie API server failure occurs, mouse clicks may continue to be unresponsive within the web browser.

In this case, temporarily disable the WAC extension as follows, then contact the administrator.

**Solution:**

1. Go to Chrome &gt; Extensions management page. (You can easily navigate by entering chrome://extensions/ in the address bar)
2. Find QueryPie Web Secure (extension) from the list of all extensions and disable the toggle in the bottom right.

This allows normal browsing of web apps that are **not specified** to be accessed only through QueryPie WAC.

After QueryPie API server is normalized, you can use the extension again.
It is recommended to perform reconfiguration after enabling the extension.


#### How to Extract QueryPie Web Secure Logs

This guide explains how to extract related logs when problems occur with QueryPie Web Secure (Extension).

1. Run Chrome developer tools using the following method.
    1. Windows : Ctrl + Shift + I
    2. MacOS : Cmd + Option + I
    3. Or, right-click on the window where the problem occurred and click the `Inspect` button in the context menu

1. Click `QueryPie Web Secure` from the panel list.
2. The log extraction function runs in developer tools. Click the `Export Log` button to save the querypie-web-secure-logs.json file separately. Click the `Save` button.
3. Attach the saved log when making a CS request.
