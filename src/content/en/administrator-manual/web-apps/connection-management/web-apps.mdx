You can specify Owners and Members for Web Apps to granularly manage permissions for Just-In-Time (JIT) access requests.
The permissions for each role are clearly separated as follows.

*  **Web App Owner:** Has approval authority for JIT access requests. 
*  **Web App Member:** Has submission (application) authority for JIT access requests. 
* One user can have both Owner and Member permissions simultaneously, in which case both request submission and approval are possible.
