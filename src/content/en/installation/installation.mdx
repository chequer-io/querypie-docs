# Installation

The methods for installing QueryPie ACP products are provided in separate guide documents according to the Container execution method and the version of the installation helper program.

### Running Containers with Compose Tool

This is the general installation and execution method, and the installation method recommended by the manufacturer.
This method involves downloading, running, and stopping Container Images using Docker Compose.

In this case, two installation methods are provided depending on the version of the installation helper program.

#### Installing with setup.sh

This is the installation helper program provided to partner engineers since QueryPie Version 9.
You can download Container Images by obtaining an account on the Container Registry called Harbor.

You can install all released versions of the product.

For detailed installation methods, please refer to this document: [Installation Guide - Simple Configuration](installation/installation-guide-simple-configuration)


#### Installing with setup.v2.sh

This is the installation helper program provided to end customers and partner engineers with the release of QueryPie ACP Community Edition released in August 2025.
This method involves downloading and installing Container Images published on Docker Hub.

The installation process is automated, making it easy for first-time users to install the product.
However, the actual installation process is equivalent between the setup.sh installation method and the setup.v2.sh installation method, with the difference being that setup.v2.sh has an automated process and does not support installation of older versions such as Version 10.

It supports installation in macOS environments using Apple Silicon.

Not all released versions of the product are provided.
As of December 2025, Version 11.1.2 is provided.

For detailed installation methods, please refer to this document: [Installation Guide - setup.v2.sh (KO)](installation/installation-guide-setupv2sh)


### Installing in Kubernetes Environment

QueryPie ACP is a software product that operates in a Container environment.
While installation and execution using Compose Tool is typical, it also operates smoothly in Kubernetes environments.

When installing the product in a Kubernetes environment, both Managed Kubernetes Clusters such as AWS EKS and GCP GKE, and Self-Hosted Clusters can be used.
