# Post Installation Setup


This guide explains settings that must be performed after installation according to the operating environment.

### Common Settings

Common procedures required when using QueryPie immediately after installation.

#### QueryPie Web Base URL Settings

> Configuration path: Admin Page → General
This is the URL address of QueryPie for accessing the Web Console. <br/>(Example. `https://querypie.customer.com`)<br/>This URL is also called the Base URL of QueryPie.

This URL must not end with `/`. Please be careful not to add `/` at the end of the URL like `https://querypie.customer.com/`.

This URL is used for the following purposes.

* Used as a callback address in the authentication process of SSO Integration.
* Used in links to download User Agent from Web Console.
* For other detailed purposes, please refer to [https://chequer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/QCP/pages/876937310](https://chequer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/QCP/pages/876937310).

### Product-specific Settings

#### DAC/SAC: Proxy Connection Address Settings

Connect to QueryPie Database and register the address for DAC/SAC Proxy connection.

<Callout type="info">
To connect to QueryPie Database from QueryPie Web Console, DB connection settings are required: [DB Connections](../administrator-manual/databases/connection-management/db-connections)

The following information is required for Database connection settings: QueryPie MySQL Hostname, Username, Password.

* Hostname: `host.docker.internal`
* Username: `querypie` (for default settings)
* Password: (Check DB_PASSWORD in the compose-env file in the QueryPie installation directory.)

Values set in compose-env such as DB_PASSWORD, REDIS_PASSWORD, KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY must be stored securely.
Please be careful not to expose these values to others.
</Callout>

Replace the `<customer-proxy-address>` part below with your company's Proxy connection IP or domain and execute the query.

<Callout type="important">
The address must not include a Scheme such as `http` or `https`.
</Callout>
```
UPDATE querypie.proxies SET host = '<customer-proxy-address>' WHERE id = 1;
```

If the query executes without errors, run the following query to verify the registration.
```
SELECT * FROM querypie.proxies;
```

After registering the Proxy connection address in QueryPie Database, you do not need to restart the Server Container.
When you try to log in from User Agent, after authentication through the web browser, User Agent will be ready to use.

After configuration, QueryPie Container restart is required to issue TLS certificates matching the registered address internally.
