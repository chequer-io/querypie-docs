# Prerequisites


### Summary

Before proceeding with installation, you must prepare the following.
In summary, they are as follows.

* 1 Linux server
* 1 PC with a web browser installed

### Server Environment

* 1 server computer with Linux OS installed: referred to as `Server VM` below.
    * You can also use cloud services such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform.
* Hardware performance and capacity
    * Server computer specifications are presented with 4 vCPUs and 16GiB Memory as basic specifications. This performance specification is suitable for testing various QueryPie features.
    * For cases where hundreds or more users use it with high traffic, we recommend 8 vCPUs and 32 GiB Memory as recommended specifications.
    * We recommend configuring the Root file system size to 100GiB or more.
* CPU Architecture
    * CPU recommends x86_64 or AMD64 architecture. Please apply CPUs such as AMD64, Intel Xeon.
    * <Badge color="yellow">BETA</Badge> Starting from QueryPie version 11.1.1, it supports ARM64 architecture CPUs.
        * Since production-level functional testing has not been performed, it is recommended for functional testing and trial use in development environments.
        * For AWS, you can use instance types such as `t4g.xlarge`, `m7g.xlarge`.
    * <Badge color="yellow">BETA</Badge> Starting from QueryPie version 11.1.1, it supports macOS environments using Apple Silicon CPUs.
* `Server VM` must have an IP address that users can access.
    * We recommend setting a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for connection.
* The following ports must be open on `Server VM`.
    * TCP 80: QueryPie web service port
    * TCP 9000: Port for QueryPie User Agent to connect to QueryPie Server
    * (Optional): If you want to access via HTTPS using port 443 TLS(SSL) instead of 80, TCP 443 port access must be possible.

<Callout type="info">
This summarizes server recommended specifications for Production environments.
* Basic specifications: Hardware: CPU 4 vCPUs, AMD64 Architecture, Memory 16 GiB, Disk 100 GiB+
    * AWS EC2: m6i.xlarge, m7i.xlarge, 
    * GCP Compute Engine: c4-standard-4, n4-standard-4 (or AMD64 architecture -standard-4 models)
* Recommended specifications for multi-user production environments: Hardware: CPU 4 or 8 vCPUs, AMD64 Architecture, Memory 32 GiB, Disk 100 GiB+
    * AWS EC2: m6i.2xlarge, m7i.2xlarge, r6i.xlarge
    * GCP Compute Engine: c4-standard-8, n4-standard-8 (or AMD64 architecture -standard-8 models)
* OS: Linux (install and use docker daemon)

### Linux Distributions

QueryPie ACP works normally on most Linux distributions that can use Docker and Podman.
And when using QueryPie ACP product on some Linux distributions, you can receive technical support effectively.

#### Verified Linux Distributions for Installation and Operation

* Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023: Only provided on AWS Cloud.
* Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, 24.04 LTS
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 9, 10
* Rocky Linux 8, 9

For detailed information on support status of various Linux distributions and Docker, Podman, please refer to this document: [Linux Distribution and Docker, Podman Support Status](prerequisites/linux-distribution-and-docker-podman-support-status)

### Container Engine and Compose Tool

QueryPie is provided in Container format.
Therefore, Container Engine is required.
Container Engine refers to tools for creating, running, and stopping Containers from Images, such as Docker and Podman.
Also, Compose Tool is required to easily use Container Engine.
Docker Compose is called Compose Tool.

#### Container Engine and Versions

* Docker Desktop: Version 20.10 or later
* Docker Community Edition: Version 20.10 or later
* Docker Enterprise Edition: Product name has been changed to Docker Desktop.
* Podman: Version 4.9.0 or later

#### Compose Tool and Versions

* Docker Compose: Version 2.29.0 or later
    * We recommend using Docker Compose over Podman Compose. We have verified that it works normally with Podman and Docker Compose combination.
* Podman Compose: Version 1.5.0 or later

### Server FQDN Settings and TLS Certificate

This item is not required.
However, it is a recommended item from both security and user usability perspectives.

* Prepare a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) connected to `Server VM`.
    * Prepare settings to connect to the host with FQDN by applying DNS settings connected to the IP address of `Server VM`.
* Prepare a TLS Certificate Certificate corresponding to FQDN.
    * Used to access with `https` address.

### User PC Environment

* PC with web browser installed: referred to as `User PC` below.
    * Use the latest versions of browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
    * Using a web browser is required. Even when using QueryPie User Agent, a web browser connection is required.
* `User PC` must be able to open a web browser with the IP address or FQDN of `Server VM` and access QueryPie web service.
* When installing QueryPie User Agent, it is only supported on some OSes. It can be used on OSes that support .NET8 or higher.
    * QueryPie User Agent runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux OS.
        * For Windows OS, you must use Windows 8 or later.
        * For MacOS OS, you must use MacOS 10.15 or later. We recommend MacOS 12 (Monterey) or later.
        * For Linux OS, you must use Debian 9 or later, Ubuntu 16.04 or later, Fedora 30 or later.
    * For Linux OS, headless mode is not supported. It must be run in a GUI environment using X-Window, VNC, etc.
    * If you use QueryPie only with a web browser without using User Agent, you can ignore this item.
