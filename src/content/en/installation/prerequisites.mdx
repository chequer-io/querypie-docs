# Prerequisites


### Summary

Before proceeding with installation, you need to prepare the following items.
In summary, they are as follows:

* 1 Linux server
* 1 PC with a web browser installed

### Server Environment

* 1 server computer with Linux OS installed: referred to as `Server VM` below.
    * You may use cloud services such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc.
* Hardware performance and capacity
    * The server computer specifications are presented with 4 vCPUs and 16GiB Memory as the basic specifications. This performance specification is suitable for testing various QueryPie features.
    * For cases where hundreds or more users use it with high traffic, 8 vCPUs and 32 GiB Memory are recommended as the recommended specifications.
    * It is recommended to configure the root file system size to 100GiB or more.
* CPU Architecture
    * CPU with x86_64 or AMD64 architecture is recommended. Please apply CPUs such as AMD64, Intel Xeon, etc.
    * **[BETA]** Starting from QueryPie version 11.1.1, CPUs with ARM64 architecture are supported.
        * Since production-level feature testing has not been performed, it is recommended for feature testing in development environments and trial use.
        * For AWS, instance types such as `t4g.xlarge`, `m7g.xlarge` can be used.
    * **[BETA]** Starting from QueryPie version 11.1.1, macOS environments using Apple Silicon CPUs are supported.
* `Server VM` must have an IP address that users can access.
    * It is recommended to set up a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for connection.
* The following ports must be open on `Server VM`:
    * TCP 80: QueryPie web service port
    * TCP 9000: Port for QueryPie User Agent to connect to QueryPie Server
    * (Optional): If you want to access via HTTPS using port 443 TLS(SSL) instead of 80, TCP 443 port access must be available.

Summary of recommended server specifications for production environments.
* Basic specifications: Hardware: CPU 4 vCPUs, AMD64 Architecture, Memory 16 GiB, Disk 100 GiB+
    * AWS EC2: m6i.xlarge, m7i.xlarge, 
    * GCP Compute Engine: c4-standard-4, n4-standard-4 (or -standard-4 models with AMD64 architecture)
* Recommended specifications for multi-user production environments: Hardware: CPU 4 or 8 vCPUs, AMD64 Architecture, Memory 32 GiB, Disk 100 GiB+
    * AWS EC2: m6i.2xlarge, m7i.2xlarge, r6i.xlarge
    * GCP Compute Engine: c4-standard-8, n4-standard-8 (or -standard-8 models with AMD64 architecture)
* OS: Linux (install and use docker daemon)

### Linux Distributions

QueryPie ACP works properly on most Linux distributions that can use Docker and Podman.
And, when using QueryPie ACP products on some Linux distributions, you can receive technical support effectively.

#### Verified Linux Distributions for Installation and Operation

* Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023: Only available on AWS Cloud.
* Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, 24.04 LTS
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 9, 10
* Rocky Linux 8, 9

For detailed information on the support status of various Linux distributions and Docker, Podman, please refer to this document: [Linux Distribution and Docker, Podman Support Status](prerequisites/linux-distribution-and-docker-podman-support-status)

### Container Engine and Compose Tool

QueryPie is provided in Container format.
Therefore, a Container Engine is required.
Tools that create, run, and stop containers from images, such as Docker and Podman, are called Container Engines.
Also, to easily use Container Engines, a Compose Tool is required.
Docker Compose is called a Compose Tool.

#### Container Engine and Version

* Docker Desktop: Version 20.10 or later
* Docker Community Edition: Version 20.10 or later
* Docker Enterprise Edition: The product name has been changed to Docker Desktop.
* Podman: Version 4.9.0 or later

#### Compose Tool and Version

* Docker Compose: Version 2.29.0 or later
    * Docker Compose is recommended over Podman Compose. It has been verified to work properly with the combination of Podman and Docker Compose.
* Podman Compose: Version 1.5.0 or later

### Server FQDN Setup and TLS Certificate

This item is not required.
However, it is a recommended item from both security and user usability perspectives.

* Prepare a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) connected to `Server VM`.
    * Apply DNS settings connected to the IP address of `Server VM` to prepare settings that can connect to the host with FQDN.
* Prepare a TLS certificate Certificate corresponding to FQDN.
    * It is used to access with `https` address.

### User PC Environment

* PC with web browser installed: referred to as `User PC` below.
    * Use the latest versions of browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.
    * Using a web browser is required. Even when using QueryPie User Agent, a connection via web browser is required.
* `User PC` must be able to open a web browser with the IP address or FQDN of `Server VM` and access the QueryPie web service.
* When installing QueryPie User Agent, it is only supported on some OS. It can be used on OS that supports .NET8 or higher.
    * QueryPie User Agent runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux OS.
        * For Windows OS, Windows 8 or later version must be used.
        * For MacOS OS, MacOS 10.15 or later version must be used. MacOS 12 (Monterey) or later version is recommended.
        * For Linux OS, Debian 9 or later, Ubuntu 16.04 or later, Fedora 30 or later versions must be used.
    * For Linux OS, headless mode is not supported. It must be run in a GUI environment using X-Window, VNC, etc.
    * If you use QueryPie only with a web browser without using User Agent, you may ignore this item.
