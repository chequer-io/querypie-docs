## Q&A

**Q. Is domain configuration required even when using only in an internal network?** <br/> **A.** You may use an IP address.
However, it must be an address (IP or domain) that can be accessed from the user's PC.
Do not use a Private IP Address that cannot be accessed from the user's PC.


**Q. Is domain configuration required when using Okta as IdP?** <br/> **A.** Yes, it is required.
In Okta, when entering the Base URL, you must use a URL that includes the https:// protocol.
If you enter only http:// or an IP address, the following error will occur and configuration will not be possible.

<Callout type="error">
*Please review the form to correct the following error(s):*
*Is not an HTTPS URL. Valid example:* [https://www.okta.com](https://www.okta.com)
</Callout>

Therefore, please configure using an HTTPS URL that includes a domain.
