## Q&A

**Q. Is domain configuration necessary even when using only in an internal network?** <br/> **A.**  You can use an IP.
However, it must be an address (IP or domain) that can be accessed from user PCs.
You should not use a Private IP Address that cannot be accessed from user PCs.


**Q. Is domain configuration necessary when using Okta as IdP?** <br/> **A.**  Yes, it is necessary.
Okta requires a URL that includes the https:// protocol when entering the Base URL.
If you enter only http:// or an IP address, the following error occurs and configuration is not possible.

<Callout type="error">
*Please review the form to correct the following error(s):*
*Is not an HTTPS URL. Valid example:* [https://www.okta.com](https://www.okta.com)
</Callout>

Therefore, please configure using an HTTPS URL that includes a domain.
