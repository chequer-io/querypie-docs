# On-Premise VM Requirements

### Overview

This guide provides instructions for operating QueryPie Server Container on a Virtual Machine running on an On-Premise physical server.
For production environment operation, we recommend applying the following configuration.

* Apply High Availability configuration
* Apply L7 Load Balancer and L4 Load Balancer for high availability and load distribution suitable configuration.
* Place 2 or more VM Instances as Upstream servers of Load Balancer. If the required processing capacity is high, apply Scale-Out configuration by increasing the number of VM Instances.
