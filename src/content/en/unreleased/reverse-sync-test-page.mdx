# Reverse Sync Test Page

Installation instructions for QueryPie ACP are provided in separate guides depending on the container runtime method and the version of the installation helper script.

### Running Containers with Compose Tool

This is the standard installation and execution method, and the manufacturer-recommended approach.
It uses Docker Compose to pull, run, and stop Container Images.

In this case, two installation methods are available depending on the version of the installation helper script.

#### Installing with setup.v2.sh

This is the installation helper script provided to end customers and partner engineers alongside the release of QueryPie ACP Community Edition in August 2025.
It installs by pulling Container Images published on Docker Hub.

The installation process is automated, making it easy for first-time users to install the product.
The installation process executed by setup.v2.sh is equivalent to that of setup.sh.
The difference is that setup.v2.sh automates the process and does not support installation of older versions such as Version 10.
For more detailed differences, please refer to this document: [Comparison of setup.sh and setup.v2.sh](../installation/installation/comparison-of-setupsh-and-setupv2sh)

Installation on macOS environments using Apple Silicon is supported.

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to this document: [Installation Guide - setup.v2.sh](../installation/installation/installation-guide-setupv2sh)

#### Installing with setup.sh

This is the installation helper script that has been provided to partner engineers since QueryPie ACP Version 9.
You can pull Container Images by obtaining an account on a Container Registry called Harbor.

### Installing on Kubernetes

QueryPie ACP is a software product that runs in container environments.
While installing and running with Compose Tool is the standard approach, it also runs smoothly on Kubernetes environments.

When installing the product in a Kubernetes environment, both Managed Kubernetes Clusters such as AWS EKS and GCP GKE, and Self-Hosted Clusters are supported.
